# PolCare - Innovation Roadmap

## AI-Powered Medical Help and Navigation for Tourists

### Unique Value Proposition

‚ö° **Emergency Prevention Protocol** - Proactive AI triage system prevents medical emergencies  
üåç¬ç **Tourist-First Design** - Built specifically for foreigners, not localized existing solutions  
üîó **Real-Time Integration** - Insurance + Healthcare + Maps + Translation in one automated conversation  
üéØ **Cultural Bridge Technology** - AI understands both tourist expectations and Polish medical culture
